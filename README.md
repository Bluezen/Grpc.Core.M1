# Grpc.Core.M1

[![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/contrib.grpc.core.m1)](http://nuget.org/packages/Contrib.Grpc.Core.M1)

The purpose of this project is to provide a prebuilt version of the needed native **.dylib** for
ï£¿ M1 CPUs when using the legacy [C# Grpc library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Grpc.Core).

The future of Grpc and C# is described [here](https://grpc.io/blog/grpc-csharp-future/).

## Usage

In addition to your Grpc package reference, just add a reference to this package in your *.csproj* file:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Grpc" Version="2.39.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Contrib.Grpc.Core.M1" Version="2.39.1" />
</ItemGroup>
```

If you're leveraging another package that implicitly pulls this in, you might need to explicitly include a package
reference to the **Grpc** package anyways - if your library works with the version this package is built for.
